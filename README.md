# Petrol

Because maintaining strings of SQL leads to :shit:

## Install

*Maven instructions incoming.*

## Use It

### As a query builder

```java
new QueryBuilder().select("*").from("table");
```

will produce the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table
```

*"Oh, that's even longer than writing the SQL! Why would you want that?"* 

Oh, because:

```java
String sql = "select m.* " +
   "from flarbs f " + // <-- eww multiline concatenation
   "inner join scrabs s on f.id = s.flarbs_id " + // <-- accidentally miss a space and you die
   "where f.teacher_type_id = 42";
```

:flushed: :gun:

And that was the neatest string of SQL I could find.

Here's the same query built with petrol:

```Java
String sql = new QueryBuilder()
   .select("s.*")
   .from("flarbs f", table ->
      table.innerJoin("scrabs s").on("f.id = s.flarbs.id"))
   .where(conditions ->
      conditions.apply("f.teacher_type_id = 42"))
   .toPlainString();
```

*"That's nice, but why not use an ORM?"* I like ORMs for writes but prefer plain ol' SQL for reads.

### As a JPA interface

Instantiate a new `Petrol`, bringing your own `javax.persistence.EntityManager`. Petrol exposes two methods, `#query`, for building the statement and `#stream` for executing it. Use built in Java 8 methods to act on the result. Here's a complete example:

```Java
// instantiate petrol
Petrol db = new Petrol(myEntityManager);

// build the query and execute it
db.query(Sloth.class, query ->
   query.select("s.*")
      .from("sloths s")
      .where("s.name = 'Kristen Bell'")
   )
.stream()
.findFirst() // Optional<Sloth>
```
